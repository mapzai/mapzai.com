<p>Thanks for dropping by our blog. We are currently building out the MAPZAI platform and are in pre-beta.
MAPZAI is an easy to use and powerful platform for displaying your geospatial data, business data and
generating insights and strategy.</p>
<!--more-->
<h4>Why are you doing this?</h4>
<p>We have used various map platforms over the years from basic Google Maps to professional, full-featured GIS systems
for professional surveyors and geospatial analysts. What has been lacking is a simple tool to quickly load data
and visualise it geographically, analyse relationships and extract insights or visualisations. Mapzai is our
attempt at building such a platform.</p>

<h4>Why blog?</h4>
<p>As users of open-source tools, software and data we are big believers in the open-source movement. Our goals
 are to allow more people to make use of open data and open source tools to learn, gain insights and understand.<p>

<h4>How can I get in touch?</h4>
<p>We actively encourage comments on our blog. We expect and kindly request that all comments stay on topic 
	and civilised, but other than that we hope to spark healthy debate.</p>
